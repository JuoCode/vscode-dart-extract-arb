## Features

## This extension adds a single code action : 

### `Extract String to ARB`

Extract selected text, prompt for a key or infer from text, update ARB files with DeepL translations, generate dart code, and replace hardcoded strings with the generated key.

## Quick Setup

You should already have a l10n.yaml file in your project. If not, create one.
it uses flutter's official options for internationalization. see [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility-and-internationalization/internationalization#configuring-the-l10n-yaml-file)

This extension extends existing options with the following options:

### Options with default values
```yaml
# l10n.yaml (extension specific options)
translate: true                             # Enable translation 
key-prefix: AppLocalizations.of(context)!.   # Key prefix for translation
import-line: ""                             # Import line if needed
auto-name-key: false                        # Generate key name based on text
generate : true                             # auto run flutter gen-l10n
key-prefix: AppLocalizations.of(context).   # Key prefix for translation
auto-name-key: true                         # Generate key name based on text
key-name-language: en                       # Language to use for key name
import-line: ""                             # Import line if needed
```

For the translation feature to work, you need to add your Deepl API key in vscode settings.json file:

`"flutter.deeplApiKey": "your-key",`   

You can get a free one [here](https://www.deepl.com/en/pro#developer)

And that's it! You're ready to go ðŸš€

If you want to add a feature or file a bug, please open an issue/PR on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tempo-riz/vscode-dart-extract-arb)

## Pro tips
You can define an extension getter to access your translations more concisely:
```dart
extension ContextExt on BuildContext {
  AppLocalizations get t => AppLocalizations.of(this);
}

// then instead of this
Text(AppLocalizations.of(context).yourKey)

// use it like this:
Text(context.t.yourKey)
```
Don't forget to update the `key-prefix` & `import-line` options in l10n.yaml ;)
